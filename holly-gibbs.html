      Holly Gibbs is a geographer who studies how and why people use land around the world
      and what these changes mean for the future of our planet. She was trained as a physical
      scientist and focuses on interdisciplinary, applied questions around human-environment
      interactions, globalization, environment, and policy.  She heads a highly trained team of
      staff scientists, economists, GIS analysts, cartographers, and student researchers who
      tackle interdisciplinary questions around Land System Science.  Gibbs has developed novel
      methods that combine Big Data, spatial analysis, remote sensing imagery, and statistical
      modeling with ground-based information on social and biophysical conditions.  She uses
      this framework to improve our understanding of the causes, patterns, and effects of land
      use change at the global scale, and particularly of tropical deforestation in Brazil and
      cropland expansion in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
      Recently, Gibbs has focused on tracking the land sources for newly expanding croplands
      and how this is influenced by different policies.  In particular, she has evaluated the
      outcomes of recent company-led efforts to reduce the deforestation caused by soybean and
      cattle pasture expansion in the Brazilian Amazon and beyond.  As public scrutiny and
      pressure from environmental organizations has increased over the last decade, the
      agricultural industry responded by making public commitments to avoid all links to
      deforestation.  She was the first to assess what these promises mean on the ground by
      using econometrics, field surveys, and maps of thousands of properties linked to different
      companies.  Gibbs leveraged the academic advancements to develop a deforestation
      monitoring tool that is now being used by meatpacking companies in Brazil. Gibbs also
      works in the U.S. where she focuses on solutions for agricultural sustainability at local to
      national levels and is particularly interested in the impact of federal policies on land and
      water resources.
      </p>
      <p>
      Since beginning her career at UW-Madison in 2011, Gibbs has been PI or Co-PI on awards
      totaling more than $53 million. Of these awards, more than $18 million have directly
      supported GLUE research activities (2011-2021). She has published in leading journals
      such as Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science.  Her
      papers have been cited more than 25,000 times.  Gibbs routinely shares her results with the
      public through print, television and radio media outlets. She passionately embodies the
      Wisconsin Idea and puts her scholarship into action through frequent expert consultations
      with policymakers, agricultural industry leaders, and environmental organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
      Gibbs was awarded the H.I. Romnes Faculty Fellowship in 2020, and was the 2017 winner
      of the College of Letters and Sciences “Deans Award for Distinguished Faculty
      Achievement”, named for Phil Certain and Dean Gary Sander. In 2018, Gibbs received an
      Office of Economic Cooperation and Development Research Fellowship for her sabbatical
      in New Zealand. She previously received the Chancellors Chancellor’s Distinguished
      Teaching Award (2016) and the University Housing Honored Instructor Award (2015).  In
      addition, she was the co-recipient of the Administrative Improvement Award (2016) for a
      student project.
      </p>
      <p>
      Gibbs has taught hundreds of undergraduates in large lecture settings and has developed
      three graduate seminars, and two capstone courses for undergraduates.  She encourages
      her students to directly engage with policy and outreach opportunities to make change now
      rather than after graduation.  Students often lead semester long food sustainability projects
      where they connect with local communities, resulting in durable change (LINK TO
      PROJECTS). To support these efforts, Gibbs and her co-PIs have obtained three
      Sustainability Innovation in Research and Education (SIRE) grants and a one-time award
      from the Office of Sustainability (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016) among other teaching grants
      (2020, 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
      Previously, Gibbs was a David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellow in the Program on
      Food Security and Environment at Stanford University. She earned her Ph.D. from the
      University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Center for Sustainability and the Global
      Environment (SAGE) where a DOE Global Change Environmental Fellowship supported her
      studies. Prior to moving to Madison, Gibbs worked as a Post-Masters Research Associate
      in Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Environmental Sciences Division where she led remote-
      sensing and GIS research for global carbon and water cycle projects. She received a B.S.
      of Distinction in Natural Resources and M.S. in Environmental Science from The Ohio State
      University.
